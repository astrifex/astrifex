[Astrifex](https://astrifex.github.io/) is an interactive SVG star generator.

## Usage

To use Astrifex, go to https://astrifex.github.io/ in your browser. Mobile
browsers will work as well, though the control design has not yet been
optimized for mobile.

To run Astrifex locally, first run `npm install`, then run `grunt`. This will
bring up a local instance of Astrifex at http://localhost:4200/.

## Inspiration

Astrifex was inspired by the star tool in [Inkscape](https://www.inkscape.org).
To quote [their documentation](https://inkscape.org/doc/shapes/tutorial-shapes.html)
on the star tool:

> Stars are the most complex and the most exciting Inkscape shape. If you want
> to wow your friends by Inkscape, let them play with the Star tool. It's
> endlessly entertaining â€” outright addictive!

While Astrifex is inspired by the Inkscape star tool, I have not looked at
their code and the exact handling of comparable settings may differ.
