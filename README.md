# Astrifex

[Astrifex](https://astrifex.github.io/) is an interactive SVG star generator.

## Usage

To use Astrifex, go to https://astrifex.github.io/ on your browser. Mobile
browsers will work as well, though the control design has not been optimized
for mobile.

To run Astrifex locally, run `gulp`. This will bring up a local instance of
Astrifex at http://localhost:8080/. That being said, Astrifex is (currently) a
browser-only app and can be run without a web server.

## Inspiration

Astrifex was inspired by the star tool in [Inkscape](https://www.inkscape.org).
To quote [their documentation](https://inkscape.org/doc/shapes/tutorial-shapes.html)
on the star tool:

> Stars are the most complex and the most exciting Inkscape shape. If you want
> to wow your friends by Inkscape, let them play with the Star tool. It's
> endlessly entertaining â€” outright addictive!

While Astrifex is inspired by the Inkscape star tool, I have not looked at
their code and the exact handling of comparable settings may differ.
